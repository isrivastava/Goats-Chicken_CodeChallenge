# Goats-Chicken_CodeChallenge
* This project is made in eclipse Java EE IDE so for running this project please import the project in eclipse. It is assumed that java is installed in the system of the user.
* Alternatively user can also run .java file present in the \Goats_Chicken_CodeChallenge\src\coristaCodeChallenge\CodeFile.java location.
* Once the user run the application, the program will ask the user to input 5-digit secret number. It is assumed that user will input 5-digit integer value only.
* The program will then guess the values using the algorithm to minimize the number of guesses.
* The random guess number generated by the algorithm is saved in GuessNumber.txt file present in the application.
* Then these numbers are checked with the 5-digit secret number one by one and output  will display all the results tried in the processing containing guess no., no. of guesses, no. of Goats and no. of Chickens.
* Note that algorithm minimizes the number of guesses. For largest 5-digit number 99999 the program takes only 46 guesses to get 5 goats which is the maximum number of guesses algorithm will make.
* The whole program took around 6 hours to complete.
* The project is also present in the github location https://github.com/isrivastava/Goats-Chicken_CodeChallenge.
